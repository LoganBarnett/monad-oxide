*** Additions
1. Add ~Option~, a structure similar to Rust's ~Option~ with ~Some~ and
   ~None~ variants.  This provides a safer alternative to using ~nil~ for
   representing optional values.  Includes all core methods: ~some?~,
   ~none?~, ~map~, ~map_none~, ~inspect_some~, ~inspect_none~, ~and_then~,
   ~or_else~, ~unwrap~, and ~unwrap_none~.

   error.  It is not in total feature parity, but much of it is usable.
